title: Org Chart Software

Why do more people not organize written code as though it reflected an org chart?

I've yet to find a really big hole in this theory. Software has been around for how long? How long have organizations been around? Right?

Organizations know how to do it. Start out running a single sandwhich shop and move up to Panera. Many large, successful organizations did a great job managing complexity oranically. Wait to hire people when we need them.

Apply this to software (noting I'm a Red-Green-Refactorist and prefer [Agility over Lean](http://www.infoq.com/articles/David-Anderson-Kanban)).

Your body of code is an organization. Consider someone at the front desk routing calls. Do VPs run queries against Oracle RAC nodes? Hopefully not. Scale your software and learn from org charts. Encapsulate responsbilities. Organizations don't want some single person with a hand in everything - that would be disasterous to maintain or scale.

It may not be perfect ... but I think it really is a marvelous analogy. The line is dynamic. What worked for the company yesterday no longer applies as we grow, etc.

Analogies like this simplify writing software. Ask yourself, what would a corporation do?
