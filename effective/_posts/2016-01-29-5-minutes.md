# Working Software ... every 5 minutes

A few years ago, the company I work for hired 2 individuals to perform at our company party. They performed an agile skit and led us in a refactoring workshop.

Most folks were disapoointed with the skit but I really got something out of the workshop.

Before that day, when working on a new feature, I was fine plodding along - 10, 20, 30 &hellip; 60 minutes with the code in a broken state as I tried to _figure_ something out.

But since then, I work to find super small slices of work I can do - the work continues to build save for a few minutes here and there. I still have to venture into unknown territory - but it doesn't look any different.
