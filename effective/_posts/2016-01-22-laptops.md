# What is so intriguing about a laptop for a software developer?

I'm not sure if this is the case for everyone, but I personally prefer coding on a 15" laptop then I do on a big screen. I feel closer to the metal. It somehow feels more intimate. It somehow feels more like a tool I am wielding. A big screen just feels more like something on the end of stick that I'm trying to control by swinging it around.

Odd.

In my ideal world I've got a Macbook Pro tethered to a 27" iMac via thunderbolt cable and I use both them simultaneously - separately or together. Splitting different types of work across the machines makes things more tangible - less context switching in my head. Sliding over to work on the build server and then back to write more code and then over to update the kanban board just feels smoother when there is a dedicated machine for each. I think it has to do with cognitive load. Like, why you aren't supposed to do _work_ in your bedroom. Your brain associates activities with the environment. When I look at my laptop and consistently see the same project - my mind makes the leap more quickly then if I've got to alt-tab and find the ... project ???? I was working on.
