Some high level thoughts to keep in mind while evaluating candidates --- and thinking abouy your future. And of note, these may seem like pretty wild generalizations - I'm just ruminating &hellip; but for what it's worth, I've personally experienced most of them.

```
computer scientist !== software engineer !== designer/developer
```

# Computer Scientist

- google, amazon, microsoft
- smart, fresh out of college, folks
- working on _hard_ problems
- value drive is not so much about software architecture
- solutions may even be in pseudo-code
- not typically involved in producing beautiful code at massive scale

# Software Engineer

- edward jones, wakovia, bank of america, city of st. louis
- firms with enterprise infrastructure
- software should work with minimal bugs and managed across developer attrition
- organizes software
- gets in a fit when abstractions aren't clearly defined
- more concerned about red-green-refactor
- focussed on [simple](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) over easy
- understands patterns
- tries to understand and leverage functional vs procedural paradigms
- tries to improve software programming as an artform
- works on intention in code
- much like house cleaning

# Startups

- mobility designer / developer

# Customer Facing

- smaller and even larger firms with smaller teams like developers that can converse well with customers
- customers include the HR department

# Teamwork

- collaboration
- communication
- defensiveness
- attitude
