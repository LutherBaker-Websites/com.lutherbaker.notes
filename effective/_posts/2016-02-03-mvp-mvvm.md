title: MVP and MVVM
---

It was pointed out to me that I really don't abide by a strict interpretation of MVP. I really everything events to _P_ and it drives mechanical actions.

To be fair, I do consider it the Event engine. Most folks intuitively pass _User_ events to the Presenter - but few pass _System_ events to the Presenter. I don't cloud the space. I drive all events to the Presenter and essentially have all the plumbing go through the Presenter.

I think of it like a company - when would I want events to circumvent my main Event engine?
