title: DevOps Definition
---

Fooled you. I don't have a definition. [theagileadmin](http://theagileadmin.com/what-is-devops/) does though.

On some level, I think DevOps is to the organization what [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) is to developers. Top decision makers with the ability to push a button and deploy something -- everything lining up from server changes to mobile app updates.

I think the jury is still out on how well the general market will support Dev Ops as a _thing._ At first blush, I think it optimizes something that many companies won't gain much from - at least, not the full-blown experience.

I think it is <span class="strike">going to be</span> expensive and difficult. I'm curious to see what types of tools and systems will become popular other then the obvious &hellip; automated builds and testing.
