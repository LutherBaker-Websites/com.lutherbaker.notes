title: Setting Expectations
---

We need to be careful &hellip; sugar coating what is actually happening when it comes to client awareness and their software projects.

You can't keep warning kids about what is going to happen. Eventually, you have to let go and simply help them through it. Kids have to get acclimated to facing trials and tribulations and then working through them. What we do is help them better prepare and then address the tribulations. We don't escape them per se. We face them, prepared, with appropriate expectations. They've got to grow _through_ them.

Similarly, clients need to get comfortable with picking priorities, working through and then managing outcomes. Stop it with the tight deadlines and expectations chatter and talk scope and getting things done. Don't hide or feed into the fanaticism surrounding unrealistic goals. Work the process, advocate the process and help folks get comfortable with the process. Do not revert and succumb to satisfying budget goals for sake of saving face.

You are doing them a disservice. They need to see what is really going on - they need to develop coping mechanisms. You are not here to feed the beast.

Don't sugar coat it - and don't reel back in fear because you know they'll be upset. Help them get over it. Play an advisor role. When they see how calmly you face your fears, they will mimic that.
