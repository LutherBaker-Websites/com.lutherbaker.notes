# How should I organize and track reveries, musings, notes, projects etc.

- meta
  - an inbox to capture light (longer then twitter, shorter than blog post) thoughts about things like the above
  - most posts begin with a specific question
  - most content is bulleted and terse
- blogs
  - most content it paragraph form
  - a technical blog might emphasize a specific skill or teach a specific technique
    - most content is build up from first principles
	- most content has intention to teach or make a point
	- opionated
	- encourage commenting
  - a business blog might also act as a type of _Captain's Log_
    - such a use might keep you honest
	- might build up a following for a product release
	- might build up empathy for what you are attempting to do
	- might be boring in general or individually and yet, rather exciting as a whole
	- not really opinionated
	- might be situational
	- comments could be support or just plain messy
- podcasts
  - relax a bit and talk something through
  - often have another voice in the conversation
  - sometimes pits adversarial viewpoints against each other
- lightning
  - quick little points to make
  - sometimes easier to make a point when talking about it
  - less formal then a blog post
- presentations
  - most formal
  - slides or time periods with a very specific message
  - includes _shocker_ statements along with narration voice
  - epitome of story telling
  - might want to work down the chain from here
- coding sessions
  - talk yourself through it
  - get it out
  - transparency
  - learn as you work it out
  - organize it in your head
- websites
  - generally act as indexes to products
