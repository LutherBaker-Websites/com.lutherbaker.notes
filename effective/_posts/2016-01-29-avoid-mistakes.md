Several years back, I took a carpentry class. One of the things I learned was not that experienced tradesmen knew how to remove poorly struck nails better than noobs. It was that they didn't strike nails poorly.

Experience isn't always about getting out of rough place - I dare say its more about not blocking yourself in.

Experienced software development leads or teams are going to do a better job positioning themselves and consequently spend less time working themselves out of jams. It has two-fold pay-off. No time spent backtracking as well as more time being productive.
