# Steps for Continuous Learning

The underlying goal of learning is to understand the **vision** and get comfortable with different **implementations** of said vision.

A songwriter must understand both the goal of a song and then proceed to carry it out.

1. Theory
  - seek to understand the **vision**
  - motivate the idea
  - answer the perpetual question _why_
  - consider and understand how this affects or plays a role in the future
  - constantly evolving
2. Focus
  - seek to understand the **implementation**
  - study the topic
  - explicit and directed focus
  - examine existing, examples
3. Lookalike
  - given the vision and implementation, reimplement
  - this stage pulls the two abstract ideas together
  - this stage separates the critic from the artist
  - this stage distinguishes between the listener that can tell you they were moved and can note trends or patterns in the music from the person actually creating the music - working hard to manifest a vision
4. Practice
  - create the vision
  - create the implementation
  - at this stage, you try your hand at it
5. Produce
  - to a certain extent, this is just a matter of keeping the good stuff you created in stage 4
