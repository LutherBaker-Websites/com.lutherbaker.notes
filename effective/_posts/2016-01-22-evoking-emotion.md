Consider two aspects of things one produces: _functionality_ and _emotional response_.

- working toward functionality is hard
- working toward emotional response is hard
- being aware of both is not common
- folks whose work is typically associated with one of these are notoriously unaware of the other

The greatest songwriters are inherently aware of both. [Max Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Martin) is best known for his melody writing skills but were it not for his ability to harmonize and package those melodies into popular form he'd likely be another face in the crowd. As I see it, his real gift lies in both his awareness and his sustained ability to consistently combine the two - creating emotional drive within the context of popular form.

What good is a book that has no plot? What good is a book with no story?

What good is an animated short with no storyline?

I'm convinced that one of the distinguishing factors between amateurs and professionals is that in most occupations, professionals manage more than one thing at a time - and maybe more specifically, these two things.
