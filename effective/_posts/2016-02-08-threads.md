title: Organizing By Thread
---

To help me organize my day, I'm going to take a side sheet of paper and jot down columns for _threads_. In this case, a thread is a line of thought. More specifically, a thread represents something like _work_, _family_, or some _hobby_. I will make use of the paper by jotting down ideas down under their corresponding thread.

I want to be careful not to fill this sheet of paper with notes or fancy diagrams that are specific to problems I'm working on. This sheet needs to sit off to the side and act more like a table of contents to my thoughts - as opposed to a scratchpad.
