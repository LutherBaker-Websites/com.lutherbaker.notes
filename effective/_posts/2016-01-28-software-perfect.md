title: Software is Not a Game of Perfect
---

I don't fully understand why developers push back so hard when someone requests they do something in less time.

Technically, the dev isn't being asked to cut corners &hellip; and who's to say it's not a subliminal request for the developer to _lean_ down.

A part of me feels it a compelling challenge to give them something within their constraints. Timing is a big thing. There are so many opportunities for tradeoffs when writing software - sometimes, I feel like it's OK to bubble those up to the owner to make the call.

Understandably, you're either devving for yourself &hellip; or for someone else. Personally, devving for someone else ... I find value in helping them think fast and reach new plateaus.

A song is never done. One might say the same thing about artwork. Likewise, I'm pretty sure the same can be said about software.

Also, developers make alot of tradeoffs. 
I personally think [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law) slips into this somehow. I find myself making tradeoffs all the time. Just remember the last time you worked to fix or update something at the 11th hour. Note, I didn't say working overtime - I'm just talking about the heighened productivity we seem to have when we strip away everything unnecessary.

If someone asks me to do it faster I look and we talk about things we can _lean_ out. It'll likely be a different end product but most folks have been OK with the tradeoffs.

Remember, there are other schedules out there. At some level, we want to flex and faciitate collaboration.
