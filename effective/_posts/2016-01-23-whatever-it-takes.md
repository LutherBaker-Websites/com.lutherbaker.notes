# Do Whatever It Takes 

I’d like to suggest that _doing whatever it takes_ is getting a bad rap because I think a few folks might be thinking of it too narrowly or superficially. _Doing whatever it takes_ does NOT and isn’t meant to mean “do whatever the client wants on demand.”

Consider that we are a room of agilists committed to *doing whatever it takes* to work at a sustainable pace to continuously deliver software.

Doing whatever it takes means constantly communicating. It means keeping everyone in the loop. It means understanding and constantly working to establish and build trust with the client. It means following through. It means confronting your teams’ demons. It means minimizing tech debt while delivering value as early and often as possible. It means facing the music and being transparent when you might not want to or the conversation isn’t in your favor.

Do whatever it takes is a wake-up-call to each and everyone of us to reconsider what we are doing. Doing whatever it takes doesn’t mean work overtime. Doing whatever it takes can take different forms. Remember what we are selling and doing and then do whatever it takes to protect that relationship. It has nothing directly to do with everyone being out of the building at 5:00. It means to engage. It means to empathize. It means to take care of the situation by considering what is best for everyone. Most of all, it means to be the activist. Be the catalyst. Don't stand in the shadows. You're should and indeed, are expected to stand up for and perform the right thing.

# Do What It Takes

Get rid of _ever_ and see if it is any. more. clear.

Do.What.It.Takes.

# API

The API is _do whatever it takes_ ... the implementation might be:

- work to establish expectations
- train the client where necessary
- consider the timelines and scope
- deliver maximum value quickly
- focus on value over efficiencies
- work late
- work early
- work at a coffee shop
- pair
- solo
- remote
- be honest
- contact executive sponsor as soon as you see you need more support
- don't be shy, do what it takes. DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
- talk to your team

# Analogies

- do whatever it takes to get them a good education
  - does that mean we stay up late at night?
- do whatever it takes to get them a place on the soccer team
  - does that mean we bribe the coach?
  - does that mean we practice with them

- preparation, conditioning, flow, communication, manage project
  - it means we must become engaged
  - we must accept responsibility
  - we must prepare the client
  - if they are not prepared

The underlying goal is that the founders want to know that they can trust you can and will handle any particular situation. If things are going bad, ask yourself how it got to this? Are you in over your head? What should you do? Accept responsibiilty. Call for help? Do you think extra work needs to be done? Do you think you want to call in reinforcements? Can you empathize with the client?

This isn't a finger pointing exercise. You can't walk away and just flippantly say "well, I didn't expect that too happen". The point is that you are a representative - and that if you understand that the client needs a complete picture, you need to think about that clear picture. Do whatever it takes means you have to stay in the know!

- ask yourself how it got to this?
- ask yourself how the customer, another human, can get out of this?
- ask yourself what is available to you to figure out?
- hours? what about asking for help?
- what about simply considering that you are a responsbile party and that your contribution is necessary

# What it doesn't mean

It doesn't mean work overtime unless that is what you take it too mean.

- unless in your past, all your work has been handed down to you with no say
- unless you feel you're just a cog in the wheel and your input is negligible
- and then, just like that, you'll notice that we can use this slogan to actually uncover problems and holes within our own teams
- its perspective
- defend what you're doing ... but investigate these words and come to their meaning yourself
- consider how you can defend what you're doing and remain consistent with these terms.

# Jobs

- different jobs have different planes of value
- selling software is different then hardware sales
- selling agility is different then hardware sales
- but consider that the motto sticks and works for both
- both are hard work
- one has a limited creative zone within which to work
- the other, almost boundless
- be mindful in either case of your client
- determine if you're committed to helping them
- determine if you're committed to doing what it takes to avoid situations, manage, work through and even enjoy what it takes
- embrace it

# Deck

- what is the underlying meaning?
- imagine yourself as a single person company, what would it mean then?
- how would you implement that
- how would you prepare differently then if you _didn't_ consider that your sales point
- if you're not the smartest person in the room and don't have the most money ... what do you have?
- demonstrate that
- do what it takes is a call to action that you, the individual on your team, need to be engaged
  - you need to know what is going on
  - you need to contribute
  - you need to help head off problems ahead of time
  - do whatever it takes
  - think for and help the customer
