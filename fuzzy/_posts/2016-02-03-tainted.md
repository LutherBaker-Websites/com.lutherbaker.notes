Mentioned today that I like working with new people. Our team is mostly comprised of new people - and we're having a largely successful project.

Is there a connection there?

New people seem more openly receptive to trying things - and following along for a bit. Is it try that it isn't until they form a strong opinion that things potentially start to go awry?

I don't know, will check back soon.
