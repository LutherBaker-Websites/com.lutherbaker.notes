title: Is Anyone Ever Really Ready?
---

Can anyone ever really prepare for success? Are we fooling ourselves into thinking we really had something to do with it? Do we suddenly begin over managing once the stakes get higher?

I want to follow my gut. I want to _make_ things work. I don't want to investigate different models and see which one is financially viable. I know how I want to work and that is how I want to make things work. First time parents often want to wait until they are _ready_ - and even when they have a baby, they really aren't _ready_. But do they do ok? Sure. They work through it.

Think abou it. You can't really get all your ducks in a row to handle everything. You just have to trust yourself and know you can get _through_ anything. So, decide how you want things to work and then head toward that goal. Don't stand for nothing. Don't waver. Pick something and commit. Remember, it is largely the downstream decisions - your compensation skills that will make it or break it. Trust those.

Remember the Dreyfuss Model in Refactor Your Wetware - novice folks want rules and concrete things. Experts want context. Learn to work by making good decisions in context. Then, you are ready for _Creativity Inc_.
