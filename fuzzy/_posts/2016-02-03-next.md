title: What Next
---

I'm struggling a bit here in 2016 to decide what I want to do in my spare time to help me attain my goals. As I get older I feel more and more confident each day about how it's all going to happen - but I don't know how to ignite it. I don't know how to get it started.

After reading (listening to) Creativity, Inc, I've decided to stop overthinking the _business model_ and start with creating a great product. I didn't realize it but those directors spend years on 1 film. Full time. The script changes many times - goes through several iterations.

I've decided to stop second guessing my work and stay the course, doing the work I truly love to do. If I learn agile along the way, so be it. If I learn how teams collaborate, so be it. I've decide it takes times and lots of rework to finish any single movie.

Going forward, I've got to think longer term.
