title: Fuzzy Bearings

I've always thought that my code based posts would be an _effective programming_ effort but lately I've started to second guess that.

If I'm working on a project for Fuzzy Bearings, I'd like to drum up noise for it. I'd like to use Fuzzy Bearings' blog.

If I'm giving a high end class I'd use Effective Programming but if I'm simply tracking my progress and noting a few UIUX decisions along the way, maybe I can use Fuzzy Bearings for that. I'd like to pick one and not keep confusing myself. I think these posts could likely fit under Fuzzy Bearings as being technical but not advisory. In fact, Fuzzy may service better as a catch-all and Effective Programaming a polished, thought-out, training site.

I don't know - but I think I could start pushing things to Fuzzy sooner then later under this new perspective.
