# Who is Double Fine?

... an American video game developer founded in July 2000 by Tim Schafer after his departure from LucasArts. He started Double Fine with programmers David Dixon and Jonathan Menzies in what was once a clog shop in San Francisco. After several months of working on the demo for what would become Psychonauts, a mixture of personnel from the Grim Fandango development team and other new employees were slowly added to begin production. &mdash;[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Fine_Productions)
