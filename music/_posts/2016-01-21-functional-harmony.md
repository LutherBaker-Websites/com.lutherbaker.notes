# [Functional Harmony in Jazz](http://www2.siba.fi/muste1/index.php?id=85&la=en)

Why is the subdominant a fourth degree in classical music and a second degree in jazz?

On the surface, this sometimes confusing difference seems like a matter of taste, but there is solid background for it. Theory teaching in classical music traditionally builds on triad harmony; the cadence IV - V - I is a prototype of the S-D-T phenomenon. Jazz and popular music, however, are based on harmonies with four-note chords; there the corresponding cadence S-D-T is in the form II-V-I. What is essential here is the tonic included in the subdominant chord which moves to the leading note and back. Therefore, in triad harmony, the second degree, lacking this decisive note, is not suitable for a basic subdominant. In harmonies with four-note chords, either degree would do, but the second degree with a stronger tonic movement is more common (see above).
